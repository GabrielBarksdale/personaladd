        <p>
          My Name is Gabriel Barkdale, I was born on the 18th of January in the year of 1994. I've always been interested in tech since as long as I could remember. Along my high school years I got wrapped up into different sports (football and basketball). I used to be an avid music listener of all kinds of genres with hip hop and pop being my go to genres. July of 2022 was the begining of my software developer career. I plan on using this skillset to teach my family and kids all over the importance of having the skillset. Going into this bootcamp that I currently attend, I knew that I didnt have the funding tangeable but I have such a strong faith that I will make it work someway or somehow. Hopefully after I obtain my certificate in May of 2023 I'll be able to tell my story to others and inspire them to not focus on what you dont have rather than focusing on how to get what you dream of having.
